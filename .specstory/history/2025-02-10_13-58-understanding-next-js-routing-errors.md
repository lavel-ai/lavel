@(authenticated) 

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's break down this error and how to fix it.

**The Core Problem: Catch-All Route Placement**

The error message `Invalid segment Dynamic("caseId"), catch all segment must be the last segment modifying the path` is telling you that you have a routing conflict in your Next.js application.  It's specifically related to how you've defined your dynamic routes and catch-all routes within your `app` directory (using the App Router).

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Catch-All Segments (`[...catchall]`):**  A catch-all segment in Next.js is denoted by square brackets with an ellipsis (`...`).  For example, `[...slug]` or `[...catchall]`.  It's designed to capture *all* remaining path segments after a certain point in your URL structure.  Think of it like a wildcard that grabs everything that follows.  The key rule is: **A catch-all segment must be the *last* segment in a route.**

2.  **Dynamic Segments (`[caseId]`):** A dynamic segment is denoted by square brackets without an ellipsis, like `[caseId]`. It captures a single, specific segment of the URL.

3.  **The Conflict:** You have a route structure where a dynamic segment (`[caseId]`) appears *after* a catch-all segment (`[...catchall]`).  This is illegal in Next.js routing.  The catch-all, by definition, should consume everything that follows, so there's nothing left for the `[caseId]` to capture.

**Your Specific Situation**

The error message points to this structure:

```
(authenticated)/[catchall]/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx
```

*   `(authenticated)`: This is likely a route group, used for layout organization (authentication-related pages).
*   `[...catchall]`: This is your catch-all segment.  It's intended to capture a variable number of path segments.
*   `cases`: This is a static segment.
*   `[caseId]`: This is a dynamic segment, intended to capture a specific case ID.
*   `page.tsx`: This is your page component.

The problem is that `[...catchall]` is *before* `cases/[caseId]`.  The catch-all will try to grab everything, including `/cases/something`, leaving nothing for `[caseId]`.

**The Solution: Restructure Your Routes**

You have a few options to fix this, depending on what you intend your routes to do. The most likely solution is to remove the catchall, since it does not seem to be needed.

**Option 1: Remove the Catch-All (Most Likely)**
If you don't actually need a catch-all, and you just want to handle routes like `/cases/123`, `/cases/456`, etc., then the simplest solution is to remove the `[...catchall]` segment entirely:

*   **Change:**  Rename the directory `[catchall]` to something static, or eliminate it if it's not serving a purpose.  For example, if all your authenticated routes are directly under `(authenticated)`, you might just move `cases` up a level:

    ```
    apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx
    ```

    This structure directly supports URLs like `/cases/123`.

**Option 2:  Catch-All *After* `[caseId]` (Less Common, but Possible)**

If you *do* need a catch-all, but you want it to capture segments *after* the `caseId`, you'd restructure like this:

```
apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/[...catchall]/page.tsx
```

This would handle URLs like:

*   `/cases/123/details`
*   `/cases/123/documents/report.pdf`
*   `/cases/123/comments/new`

The `[caseId]` would capture `123`, and the `[...catchall]` would capture the rest (`details`, `documents/report.pdf`, `comments/new`).  This is less common for a top-level `caseId` route, but it's a valid structure.

**Option 3:  Catch-All *Replaces* `[caseId]` (If `caseId` is part of a larger path)**

If your `caseId` is actually just *one part* of a longer, variable path, you might use *only* the catch-all:

```
apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[...catchall]/page.tsx
```

Then, *inside* your `page.tsx`, you would parse the `catchall` parameter to extract the `caseId` and any other segments.  For example, if the URL was `/cases/123/details`, your `params.catchall` would be an array: `['123', 'details']`.  You'd have to write code to interpret that array.

**Option 4: Route Groups for Organization (If catchall is needed for layout)**
If the `[...catchall]` is being used to apply a layout to multiple routes, but you don't actually need to *capture* the segments, you can use a *route group* instead:

```
apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx
```
and create a `layout.tsx` file in the `(authenticated)` folder.

**Implementing the Fix (Option 1 - Removal)**

Since Option 1 seems most likely, let's show the code changes for that. We'll rename the `[catchall]` directory to `cases`, and move the `[caseId]` directory up one level.

```typescript:apps/app/app/(authenticated)/[catchall]/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx
// Rename the directory:
// From: apps/app/app/(authenticated)/[catchall]/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx
// To:   apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx

// No code changes are needed within the file itself,
// as the file content is not affected by the directory renaming.
// The file path in the comment is updated for clarity.
```
Because the file contents are unchanged, I'm only showing the directory rename. The code within `page.tsx` remains exactly the same. The critical change is the directory structure.

**Next Steps**

1.  **Choose the Option:** Decide which route structure best fits your needs. Option 1 (removing the catch-all) is the most common and likely the correct one.
2.  **Restructure:** Rename/move your directories accordingly.
3.  **Test Thoroughly:** After making the changes, *test your application thoroughly*.  Make sure all your routes work as expected, including navigation, data fetching, and any dynamic behavior.  Pay close attention to any links or redirects that might have been affected by the route changes.
4.  **Vercel Link (Separate Issue):** The `[vercel-toolbar] No project info found` message is a separate issue. It means your local development environment isn't linked to your Vercel project. Run `vc link` (or `vercel link`) in your project's root directory and follow the prompts to connect it. This won't affect the Next.js routing error, but it's important for deployment.

By correctly structuring your routes, you'll resolve the `TurbopackInternalError` and ensure your application handles URLs as intended. Remember to test thoroughly after making any changes to your routing structure.

@useCases.ts @actions.ts @route.ts @cases-queries.ts 

whats wrong explain me

useCases.ts:12 
 GET http://mg.localhost:3000/api/cases 404 (Not Found)
fetchCases	@	useCases.ts:12
useCases	@	useCases.ts:27
CasesPage	@	page.tsx:31


---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's analyze the 404 error you're encountering when your `useCases` hook tries to fetch data from `/api/cases`.

**Understanding the 404 Error**

A 404 (Not Found) error means the client (your browser, in this case) sent a request to a specific URL (`http://mg.localhost:3000/api/cases`), but the server (your Next.js application) couldn't find a route handler defined for that exact path.  It's *not* a database error; it's a routing error. The request never even gets to the point of querying your database.

**The Problem: Incorrect Route Path due to Catch-All**

The root cause, building on the previous explanation about catch-all routes, is that your API route is defined *inside* the `([...catchall])` directory. This means the actual path to your API route is *not* `/api/cases`. It's something like `/[whatever catchall is]/api/cases`. Since you likely aren't passing anything for the catchall segment, NextJS is looking in the wrong place.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what's happening and how to fix it:

1.  **`useCases.ts` (Client-Side):**
    *   Your `fetchCases` function in `useCases.ts` correctly makes a request to `/api/cases`. This is the URL *relative to the root of your application*.

2.  **`route.ts` (Server-Side - API Route):**
    *   Your `route.ts` file *defines* the API endpoint, but its location within the file system determines the *actual* URL. Because it's located at `apps/app/app/(authenticated)/([...catchall])/cases/api/route.ts`, the full, correct URL to reach this endpoint would be something like `http://mg.localhost:3000/[somevalue]/cases/api`.  The `[...catchall]` segment is *part of the URL*.

3.  **The Mismatch:** The client is requesting `/api/cases`, but the server is only listening for requests at `/[something]/cases/api`.  This is why you get the 404.

**The Solution: Move the API Route (Consistent with Previous Advice)**

The fix is to move your `cases/api/route.ts` file *outside* of the `([...catchall])` directory. This will align the URL the client is requesting with the URL the server is handling. We will also move the `cases/actions.ts` file, as it is closely related.

Here's the recommended directory structure, consistent with the previous advice to remove the unnecessary catch-all:

```
apps/
└── app/
    └── app/
        ├── (authenticated)/
        │   └── cases/
        │       ├── actions.ts        <-- Moved
        │       └── api/
        │           └── route.ts     <-- Moved
        └── ...other files...
```

**Code Changes (Directory Restructuring)**

This is primarily a directory restructuring, so there are no *code* changes within the files themselves, only their locations.

```typescript:apps/app/app/(authenticated)/([...catchall])/cases/actions.ts
// Move this file:
// From: apps/app/app/(authenticated)/([...catchall])/cases/actions.ts
// To:   apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/actions.ts

// No changes to the file contents.
```

```typescript:apps/app/app/(authenticated)/([...catchall])/cases/api/route.ts
// Move this file:
// From: apps/app/app/(authenticated)/([...catchall])/cases/api/route.ts
// To:   apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/api/route.ts

// No changes to the file contents.
```

**Explanation of Changes**

*   **`actions.ts` and `api/route.ts` Moved:** We've moved these files up one level, removing them from the `([...catchall])` directory.  Now, the `route.ts` file will correctly handle requests to `/cases/api`.
* **File paths in comments are updated**

**Important Considerations and Next Steps**

1.  **`useCases.ts` Remains Correct:** Your `useCases.ts` file *does not need to change*. It's already requesting the correct *relative* URL (`/api/cases`). The problem was the server-side route definition, not the client-side request.

2.  **`page.tsx` (Where `useCases` is Used):** You mentioned `CasesPage @ page.tsx:31`. You *might* need to adjust the import path for `useCases` in your `page.tsx` file, *if* `page.tsx` is also within the `([...catchall])` directory and you're moving it. If `page.tsx` is already outside the catch-all, no changes are needed there. If you do need to change it, it would be a simple import path update.

3.  **Complete Removal of `([...catchall])`:** As discussed before, the `([...catchall])` directory is likely unnecessary.  If you've moved all the files out of it (including `page.tsx`, if it was inside), you should *delete* the empty `([...catchall])` directory.

4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After making these changes, *test your application very carefully*.  Make sure:
    *   The `/api/cases` endpoint now works correctly (no more 404).
    *   Your `CasesPage` component renders and fetches data as expected.
    *   Any other routes or components that interact with cases are still functioning.
    *   Any links or redirects related to cases are working.

5. **Vercel Link:** Remember to address the separate `vc link` issue to connect your project to Vercel.

By making these structural changes, you'll align your client-side requests with your server-side route definitions, resolving the 404 error and allowing your application to fetch case data correctly. The key is to understand how file paths in the `app` directory directly translate to URLs in your Next.js application.

_**User**_

for consistency in my project, where should i place all the routes as well as the actions @README.md we have a monorepo approach

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's discuss the best placement for your routes and actions within your monorepo structure, aiming for consistency and maintainability. This builds upon the previous discussions and considers the overall architecture described in your `README.md`.

**Key Principles**

1.  **Colocation:** Keep related code close together. This improves discoverability and makes it easier to reason about how different parts of your application interact.
2.  **Separation of Concerns:** Separate API routes (handling HTTP requests) from server actions (business logic). This promotes cleaner code and testability.
3.  **App Router Conventions:** Follow Next.js App Router conventions for file-based routing.
4.  **Monorepo Structure:** Leverage the `apps` and `packages` directories appropriately.

**Recommended Structure**

Given your project structure and the technologies you're using, here's the recommended approach:

*   **API Routes (`route.ts` files):** Place these within the `apps/app` directory, mirroring the structure of your application's pages.  Each API route should reside in a `route.ts` file within a directory that corresponds to the API endpoint's path.

*   **Server Actions (`actions.ts` files):**  Place these *next to* the `route.ts` files within the `apps/app` directory. This close proximity makes it clear which actions are used by which API routes.

*   **Shared Logic (Queries, etc.):**  Place reusable database queries and other shared logic within the `packages/database` directory (as you're already doing). This promotes code reuse and avoids duplication.

**Example: Cases Feature**

Let's illustrate this with your `cases` feature, applying the fixes from our previous discussions and solidifying the recommended structure:

```
apps/
└── app/
    └── app/
        ├── (authenticated)/  <-- Route Group for authenticated pages
        │   └── cases/         <-- Feature directory
        │       ├── api/
        │       │   └── route.ts     <-- API route: /cases/api
        │       ├── actions.ts        <-- Server actions for cases
        │       ├── page.tsx          <-- UI component for /cases
                └── [caseId]
                    ├── page.tsx      <-- /cases/[caseId]
                    ├── api
                    │   └── route.ts  <-- /cases/[caseId]/api
                    └── actions.ts     <-- Server actions for a specific case
        └── ...other features...
packages/
└── database/
    └── src/
        └── tenant-app/
            └── queries/
                └── cases-queries.ts  <-- Reusable case queries
```

**Explanation**

1.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/api/route.ts`:** This file defines the API endpoint for `/cases/api`.  The `(authenticated)` part is a route group, ensuring that only authenticated users can access this route (assuming you have a `layout.ts` within `(authenticated)` that handles authentication checks). The `cases` directory groups all cases-related files. The `api` directory contains the `route.ts` file, which handles the HTTP request.

2.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/actions.ts`:** This file contains the server actions related to cases (e.g., `getCases`, `createCase`, `updateCase`, `deleteCase`). It's placed *next to* the `api` directory, making it easy to see which actions are used by the API route.

3.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/page.tsx`:** This is your main page component for the `/cases` route.

4.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx`:** This is your page component for individual cases (`/cases/123`, etc.).

5.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/api/route.ts`:** API endpoint for a *specific* case (e.g., `/cases/123/api`).

6.  **`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/[caseId]/actions.ts`:** Server actions specific to a single case.

7.  **`packages/database/src/tenant-app/queries/cases-queries.ts`:** This file contains your reusable database queries (e.g., `getAllCases`, `getCaseById`).  These are imported and used by the server actions in `actions.ts`.

**Benefits of this Structure**

*   **Clear Organization:**  The file structure directly reflects your application's routing and functionality.
*   **Easy Navigation:**  It's easy to find the code related to a specific feature or route.
*   **Testability:**  Server actions are separate from API routes, making them easier to test in isolation.
*   **Maintainability:**  Changes to one part of the application are less likely to affect other parts.
*   **Scalability:**  This structure scales well as your application grows.
*   **Consistency:**  This approach is consistent with Next.js best practices and your monorepo setup.

**Summary of Changes from Previous State**

*   Moved `actions.ts` and `api/route.ts` files out of the `([...catchall])` directory.
*   Placed `actions.ts` files adjacent to their corresponding `api/route.ts` files within feature directories.
*   Confirmed that shared database queries remain in `packages/database`.

This structure provides a solid foundation for building and maintaining your Lavel AI application. Remember to apply this pattern consistently across all your features.

i moved as you recommended, and still getting the 404 

@route.ts 

Request URL:
http://mg.localhost:3000/api/cases
Request Method:
GET
Status Code:
404 Not Found

---

_**Assistant**_

You're very close! The issue is subtle but important. The path to your API route is now `cases/api/route.ts`, which translates to the URL `/cases/api`, *not* `/api/cases`. You have an extra `cases` segment in the URL.

**The Problem: Incorrect URL Structure**

Your `route.ts` file is inside a `cases` directory *and* an `api` directory.  This creates a nested route structure.  Next.js uses the directory structure to determine the URL.

*   **Current (Incorrect) Structure:**
    ```
    apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/api/route.ts  ->  /cases/api
    ```
    This structure creates the route `/cases/api`.

*   **`useCases.ts` (Client Request):**
    Your `useCases` hook is still (correctly) requesting `/api/cases`.

*   **Mismatch:** The client is asking for `/api/cases`, but the server is only providing `/cases/api`. Hence, the 404.

**The Solution: Adjust the Directory Structure**

You have two main options to fix this, depending on how you want your API routes to be organized:

**Option 1:  `/api/cases` (Recommended for Simplicity)**

If you want your API routes to be under a top-level `/api` prefix (which is a very common and recommended practice), you should move the `cases` directory *inside* a top-level `api` directory:

````
apps/
└── app/
    └── app/
        ├── (authenticated)/  <-- Route Group
        │   └── api/          <-- Top-level API directory
        │       └── cases/
        │           └── route.ts     <-- API route: /api/cases
        │       └── ... other API routes ...
        ├── cases/            <-- UI components for cases
        │   ├── actions.ts
        │   └── page.tsx
        └── ...other features...
````


**Code Changes (Directory Restructuring)**

````typescript:apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/api/route.ts
// Move this file:
// From: apps/app/app/(authenticated)/cases/api/route.ts
// To:   apps/app/app/(authenticated)/api/cases/route.ts

// No changes to the file contents.
````


**Explanation**

*   **`api` Directory:**  We create a top-level `api` directory *within* `(authenticated)`.  This is where *all* your authenticated API routes will live.
*   **`cases/route.ts`:** The `route.ts` file for your cases API is now located at `api/cases/route.ts`. This corresponds to the URL `/api/cases`.
* **`cases` directory:** Now this directory only contains the `actions.ts` and `page.tsx`

**Option 2: `/cases/api` (Less Common, but Possible)**

If you *specifically* want your cases API route to be at `/cases/api` (which is less conventional), you would keep the structure you currently have, but you'd need to change the URL in your `useCases.ts` file:

````typescript:apps/app/hooks/useCases.ts
// apps/app/hooks/useCases.ts

import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import type { Case } from '@repo/database/src/tenant-app/schema/main/case-schema';

/**
 * fetchCases is a helper function that calls the API endpoint.
 * It sends a GET request to /api/cases, and returns the parsed JSON,
 * which is expected to be an array of Case objects.
 */
async function fetchCases(): Promise<Case[]> {
  const response = await fetch('/cases/api'); // Changed URL
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch cases');
  }
  return response.json();
}

/**
 * useCases is a custom hook that leverages React Query's useQuery hook.
 * It automatically handles caching, re-fetching, and error handling.
 *
 * - queryKey: A unique key (['cases']) identifying this query.
 * - queryFn: The function to fetch the data (fetchCases).
 */
export function useCases(): Promise<Case[]> {
  return fetchCases();
}

```

````

**Code Changes (useCases.ts)**

   if (!response.ok) {
     throw new Error('Failed to fetch cases');
   }

```

**Explanation**

*   **`fetchCases`:** We change the URL in the `fetch` call to `/cases/api` to match the location of the `route.ts` file.

**Recommendation**

**Option 1 (creating the top-level `/api` route) is strongly recommended.** It's the standard convention in Next.js and will make your API structure much cleaner and easier to manage, especially as you add more API endpoints. It also avoids needing to change `useCases.ts`.

**After making either of these changes (Option 1 is preferred), restart your development server and test again. The 404 error should be resolved.**

Ok this worked great, now i need to seed my database starting by the reference schema @tenant-app how can i do this, since i will be testing this database, i might be deleting it over and over, so i will create a new project so we dont mess with this production one 

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's outline a robust seeding strategy for your tenant-app database, focusing on the reference schema first.  We'll create a separate script that you can run independently, and it will be designed for easy re-running during testing. We'll also discuss how to handle the "new project" aspect.

**Key Concepts and Approach**

1.  **Separate Seeding Script:** We'll create a dedicated TypeScript file (e.g., `seed-reference.ts`) that contains all the logic for inserting data into your reference tables. This keeps your seeding process isolated and manageable.

2.  **Idempotency:** The script should be *idempotent*. This means you can run it multiple times without causing errors or duplicate data. We'll achieve this by:
    *   Checking if data already exists before inserting.
    *   Using `upsert` (insert or update) operations where appropriate.  Drizzle ORM has good support for this.
    *   Potentially, including a `TRUNCATE` command at the *beginning* of the script to clear existing data, but *only* if you're absolutely sure you want to wipe the reference tables each time.  This is generally safe for reference data, but *never* do this for your `main` schema in a production environment.

3.  **Data Source:** You'll need a source for your reference data. This could be:
    *   Hardcoded arrays within the script (simplest for small datasets).
    *   JSON files (good for larger, more structured data).
    *   CSV files (if you have data in a spreadsheet format).
    *   External API (if your reference data comes from a third-party service).  We won't cover this initially, but it's an option.

4.  **Drizzle ORM:** We'll use Drizzle ORM's API to interact with the database. This provides type safety and a clean way to perform insertions.

5.  **Database Connection:** The script needs a way to connect to your database.  We'll use environment variables to configure this, making it easy to switch between your testing and (eventual) production databases.

6.  **New Project Setup (Important):** You *absolutely* should create a separate database for testing.  Here's how to manage that:
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use a `.env.local` (or similar) file in your project root to store your *test* database URL.  *Do not* commit this file to version control.  Your `keys()` function should read this environment variable.  Something like:
        ```dotenv
        TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/test_database_name
        ```
    *   **Drizzle Kit Configuration:** Your `drizzle.config.ts` already uses `keys().TEST_DATABASE_URL`.  This is perfect.  Just make sure your `.env.local` is set up correctly.
    *   **Migration:**  Run `drizzle-kit push:pg` (or whatever your migration command is) *after* setting `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. This will create the schema in your new, empty test database.

**Example Seeding Script (`seed-reference.ts`)**

Let's start with a simple example, assuming you have `states` and `cities` in your reference schema. We'll use hardcoded data for now.

```typescript
// packages/database/src/tenant-app/seed-reference.ts
import 'dotenv/config'; // Load environment variables
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import postgres from 'postgres';
import * as schema from './schema/reference'; // Import your reference schema
import { states, cities } from './schema/reference';
import { InferInsertModel } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

// Get the database URL from environment variables
const databaseUrl = process.env.TEST_DATABASE_URL;

if (!databaseUrl) {
  throw new Error('TEST_DATABASE_URL is not defined');
}

// Create a database connection
const connection = postgres(databaseUrl, { max: 1 });
const db = drizzle(connection, { schema: { ...schema } });

// Types for our seed data
type StateInsert = InferInsertModel<typeof states>;
type CityInsert = InferInsertModel<typeof cities>;

// Sample data (replace with your actual data)
const seedStates: StateInsert[] = [
  { name: 'California', abbreviation: 'CA' },
  { name: 'New York', abbreviation: 'NY' },
  { name: 'Texas', abbreviation: 'TX' },
  // ... more states
];

**Explanation and Improvements**

*   **Environment Variables:** We use `dotenv/config` to load the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` from your `.env.local` file.
*   **Database Connection:** We create a single connection using `postgres` and pass it to `drizzle`.  The `{ max: 1 }` option is important to prevent connection pool issues during seeding.
*   **Schema Import:** We import your reference schema from `./schema/reference`.
*   **Sample Data:**  `seedStates` and `seedCities` are arrays of objects that match the structure of your Drizzle schema.
*   **Idempotency (Checking for Existing Data):** Before inserting, we use `db.select().from(...).where(...)` to check if a record with the same key values (e.g., state name) already exists.  This prevents duplicate entries.
*   **Error Handling:**  A `try...catch...finally` block handles potential errors and ensures the database connection is closed.
*   **Logging:**  We log messages to the console to indicate progress and any skipped insertions.
*   **`finally` block:** The connection is *always* closed, even if an error occurs.
* **Running the script:** You can run this script with `npx tsx packages/database/src/tenant-app/seed-reference.ts`. You might want to add a script to your `package.json` for convenience:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "db:seed:reference": "tsx packages/database/src/tenant-app/seed-reference.ts"
    }
    ```
    Then you can run it with `npm run db:seed:reference`.

**Next Steps and Considerations**

1.  **Complete Data:** Replace the sample data with your actual reference data.
2.  **More Tables:** Add seeding logic for other reference tables (e.g., `courthouses`, `trial_stages`, `trial_types`, `law_branches`, `jurisdictions`).
3.  **Relationships:**  Handle foreign key relationships carefully.  In the example, we assume `stateId` values will correspond to the order in which states are inserted.  You might need to fetch IDs after inserting parent records.  For example:

    ```typescript
    // ... inside the seedStates loop ...
    const [insertedState] = await db.insert(states).values(state).returning({ id: states.id });
    console.log(`Inserted state: ${state.name}, ID: ${insertedState.id}`);

    // Then, when seeding cities:
    const seedCities: CityInsert[] = [
      { name: 'Los Angeles', stateId: insertedState.id }, // Use the retrieved ID
      // ...
    ];
    ```

4.  **Large Datasets (JSON Files):** If you have a lot of data, move it to JSON files:

    ```typescript
    // states.json
    [
      { "name": "California", "abbreviation": "CA" },
      { "name": "New York", "abbreviation": "NY" },
      { "name": "Texas", "abbreviation": "TX" }
    ]
    ```

    ```typescript
    // seed-reference.ts
    import statesData from './states.json';
    // ...
    const seedStates: StateInsert[] = statesData;
    // ...
    ```

5.  **Upsert (Alternative to Checking):** Drizzle's `onConflictDoUpdate` can simplify the logic.  Here's how you could use it for the `states` table:

    ```typescript
    // ... inside the seedStates loop ...
        await db.insert(states)
          .values(state)
          .onConflictDoUpdate({
            target: states.name, // Conflict on the name column
            set: { abbreviation: state.abbreviation } // Update the abbreviation if it exists
          });
        console.log(`Inserted or updated state: ${state.name}`);
    ```
    This will insert the state if it doesn't exist (based on the `name` being unique) and update the `abbreviation` if a state with that name *does* exist.

6.  **Transaction (Optional):** For more complex seeding operations, especially those involving multiple related tables, consider wrapping the entire seeding process in a transaction. This ensures that either all changes are applied or none are, preventing partial data insertion if an error occurs.

    ```typescript
    async function seed() {
      try {
        await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
          // ... all your seeding logic here, using tx instead of db ...
          for (const state of seedStates) {
            const [insertedState] = await tx.insert(states).values(state).returning({ id: states.id });
            // ...
          }
          // ... seed cities, etc. ...
        });
        console.log('Seeding complete!');
      } catch (error) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```

7. **Seeding Main Schema:** You can create a separate `seed-main.ts` script for your `main` schema, but *be extremely careful* with this.  You likely *won't* want to truncate these tables.  You might use this to create initial users, teams, or a few sample cases for testing.

This comprehensive guide should give you a solid foundation for seeding your reference data and setting up your testing environment. Remember to adapt the code to your specific schema and data. The key is to have a repeatable, reliable process for populating your test database.
