## What is an ADR?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural decisions made along with the context and consequences. Each ADR includes:

- **Context**: The situation that calls for a decision
- **Decision**: The choice that was made
- **Consequences**: The resulting effects, both positive and negative
- **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, superseded, etc.)

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new file in the `docs/architecture/decisions/` directory
2. Follow the ADR template format
3. Present to the team for review
4. Update the status based on the outcome
   - Use Mermaid for code-based diagrams (Mintlify supports this)

2. **Include Code Examples:**
   - Use the `<CodeGroup>` component for tabbed code examples
   - Show real examples from your codebase

3. **Create Interactive Elements:**
   - Use `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` for navigation
   - Use `<Tabs>` for alternative approaches

4. **Link Related Content:**
   - Create cross-references between documents
   - Use "See Also" sections at the end of pages

5. **Keep Documentation Updated:**
   - Establish a process for updating docs with code changes
   - Review documentation quarterly
