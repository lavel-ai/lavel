## Storing Lawyer Information in Database Schema (2/23/2025, 12:16:45 PM)

_**User**_

@index.ts this is the schema for our app @README.md i have some doubts where we should store the specific information for a lawyer would it go in the users table or in the teammembers ? 

- for example the role or specialty of the lawyer
- his phone number 
- a bio

or should we create anotyher table that i feel that adds complexity

_**Assistant**_

Based on the provided `README.md` and the structure of your database schema, here's a breakdown of where to store lawyer-specific information, along with a recommended approach and the reasoning behind it:

**Recommendation: Use the `team_members` table.**

Here's why, and how to structure it:

*   **`team_members` is the correct place:** The `team_members` table, as described in your monorepo structure, is designed to hold information about individuals *within* a tenant (organization).  Since lawyers are part of a legal firm (the tenant), this is the semantically correct place.  The `users` table, managed by Clerk, primarily handles authentication and basic user profiles across *all* tenants.  You should link `team_members` to `users`, but not store lawyer-specific details directly in `users`.

*   **Avoid Overcomplicating `users`:** The `users` table (managed by Clerk) should remain focused on authentication and basic, cross-tenant user information.  Adding tenant-specific details like lawyer specialties directly to the `users` table would violate the principle of tenant isolation and make your Clerk user data unnecessarily complex.

*   **No Need for a New Table (Usually):** Creating a separate `lawyers` table would introduce an unnecessary one-to-one relationship with `team_members` in most cases.  Since every lawyer *is* a team member, it's redundant.  You can handle different roles within the `team_members` table itself.

**Implementation Details (within `team_members`):**

Here's how you'd structure the `team_members` table to accommodate the lawyer-specific information, along with explanations:

```typescript:packages/database/src/tenant-app/schema/team-members-schema.ts
import {
	pgTable,
	text,
	timestamp,
	uuid,
	varchar,
	unique,
} from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
import { users } from '@repo/database/src/main-app/schema'; // Import from main-app
import { teams } from './teams-schema';
import { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const teamMembers = pgTable(
	'team_members',
	{
		id: uuid('id').primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
		userId: varchar('user_id', { length: 255 }).notNull(), // Link to Clerk user
		teamId: uuid('team_id')
			.notNull()
			.references(() => teams.id),
		role: text('role', { enum: ['admin', 'member', 'lawyer', 'paralegal', 'client'] }).notNull(), // IMPORTANT: Add 'lawyer' and other roles
		specialty: varchar('specialty', { length: 255 }), // e.g., "Criminal Law", "Family Law"  -- Could also be an enum
		phoneNumber: varchar('phone_number', { length: 20 }), // Store phone number
		bio: text('bio'), // Store a longer bio
		createdAt: timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
		updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').notNull().defaultNow(),
	},
	(table) => ({
		uniqueUserTeam: unique().on(table.userId, table.teamId), // Ensure unique user-team combinations
	}),
);

// Relationships
export const teamMembersRelations = relations(teamMembers, ({ one, many }) => ({
	user: one(users, {
		fields: [teamMembers.userId],
		references: [users.id],
	}),
	team: one(teams, {
		fields: [teamMembers.teamId],
		references: [teams.id],
	}),
	// Add other relationships as needed (e.g., to tasks, cases, etc.)
}));

```

Key changes and explanations in the `team_members` schema:

1.  **`userId`:**  This field is *crucial*.  It links the `team_members` record (tenant-specific) to the `users` record in your *main* application database (managed by Clerk).  This is how you connect authentication with tenant-specific data.  The `users` import comes from `@repo/database/src/main-app/schema`.

2.  **`role`:**  This is an `enum` field.  This is the *most important addition*.  You *must* include `'lawyer'` as one of the enum values.  You can also add other roles like `'paralegal'`, `'admin'`, `'client'`, etc., to distinguish different types of team members within the same organization.  This eliminates the need for a separate `lawyers` table.

3.  **`specialty`:**  This field (likely a `varchar`) stores the lawyer's area of expertise (e.g., "Criminal Law," "Family Law," "Corporate Law").  You could also make this an `enum` if you have a predefined set of specialties.

4.  **`phoneNumber`:**  A `varchar` to store the lawyer's phone number.

5.  **`bio`:**  A `text` field to store a more detailed biography of the lawyer.

6.  **`uniqueUserTeam`:** This constraint ensures that a user can only be a member of a specific team once.  This is good practice for data integrity.

7.  **Relationships:** The `teamMembersRelations` object defines how `team_members` relates to other tables.  The `user` relation is *essential* for linking to the Clerk user. The `team` relation connects the team member to their organization.

**How it all fits together:**

1.  **User Signs Up/Logs In:**  A user registers/logs in via Clerk. This creates/manages a record in the `users` table in your *main* database.

2.  **User Joins a Team (Organization):** When a user is added to a team (e.g., a law firm), a record is created in the `team_members` table *within that tenant's database*.

3.  **Linking User and Team Member:** The `team_members.userId` field stores the Clerk `user.id`, linking the tenant-specific `team_member` to the global `user`.

4.  **Identifying Lawyers:**  You can easily identify lawyers within a team by querying the `team_members` table where `role = 'lawyer'`.

5.  **Retrieving Lawyer Data:** When you need to display information about a lawyer, you'd:
    *   Get the `user.id` from Clerk (likely from the session).
    *   Query the *tenant's* `team_members` table using the `userId` and `teamId` to find the relevant `team_member` record.
    *   Access the `role`, `specialty`, `phoneNumber`, and `bio` fields from that record.

**Example (Conceptual Code - within a route handler using `getTenantDbClient`):**

```typescript
// ... inside a route handler ...
import { getTenantDbClient } from '@repo/app/utils/tenant-db'; // Or wherever your utility is

async function getLawyerProfile(userId: string, teamId: string) {
  const db = await getTenantDbClient(); // Get the Drizzle client for the current tenant

  const lawyer = await db.query.teamMembers.findFirst({
    where: (teamMembers, { eq, and }) =>
      and(eq(teamMembers.userId, userId), eq(teamMembers.teamId, teamId), eq(teamMembers.role, 'lawyer')), // Filter by role
  });

  if (!lawyer) {
    // Handle case where lawyer is not found (e.g., return null, throw error)
    return null;
  }

  // lawyer.specialty, lawyer.phoneNumber, lawyer.bio are now accessible
  return lawyer;
}

// ... use the getLawyerProfile function ...

```

**Summary of Changes to Existing Files:**

*   **`packages/database/src/tenant-app/schema/team-members-schema.ts`:**  Modify this file as shown in the code example above.  This is the *primary* change.
*   **`packages/database/src/tenant-app/schema/index.ts`:** No changes *needed* here, but it's good practice to ensure `team-members-schema.ts` is exported.
```typescript:packages/database/src/tenant-app/schema/index.ts
// ... existing code ...
export * from './team-members-schema'; // Ensure this line exists
// ... existing code ...
```
*   **No changes are required in the main-app schema files.** You are referencing the *existing* `users` table from there.

This approach keeps your data well-organized, respects tenant isolation, and avoids unnecessary complexity. It leverages the existing `team_members` table effectively and provides a clear way to identify and manage lawyer-specific information. Remember to run migrations after making schema changes.
