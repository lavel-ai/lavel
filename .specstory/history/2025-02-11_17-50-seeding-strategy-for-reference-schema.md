## Seeding Strategy for Reference Schema (2/11/2025, 5:50:26 PM)

_**User**_

I need a seeding script to seed the reference schema, we need to take into account the relations in between the tables, so we do the seeding accordingly

make an analysis of what we need to do and how, what table needs to be seed first, then how do we get the ids for tables that have a relation. @schema

I'll help you analyze the reference schema and create a proper seeding strategy. First, let's examine the schema structure.

Let me examine the schema files to understand their relationships.

Let me check some of the schema files to understand their structure and relationships.

Based on my analysis of the schema files and their relationships, here's the seeding strategy we need to implement:

### Seeding Order (Based on Dependencies)

1. **Base Tables (No Foreign Keys)**:
   - `states` - Independent table
   - `law_branches` - Independent table
   - `jurisdictions` - Independent table

2. **First Level Dependencies**:
   - `cities` (depends on `states`)
   - `courthouses` (depends on `states`, `cities`)
   - `trial_stages` (independent but used by others)
   - `trial_types` (independent but used by others)

3. **Second Level Dependencies**:
   - `trial_stages_types` (depends on `trial_stages` and `trial_types`)

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Use CSV files for each table's data (already present in `packages/database/src/tenant-app/seed/reference/`)
   - Load data using a consistent pattern

2. **ID Management**:
   - Store inserted records' IDs in memory for relationship mapping
   - Use Maps to store relationships between names and IDs

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Add proper error handling for duplicate entries
   - Implement transaction support for atomicity

Here's how we should structure the seeding script:

```typescript
// 1. Create interfaces for each table's data
// 2. Create functions to load CSV data
// 3. Create a Map to store IDs
// 4. Implement seeding in correct order
// 5. Use transactions for atomicity
```

Would you like me to start implementing this seeding script? I'll create a new file that follows this structure and handles the relationships properly. We can also modify the existing `seed-reference.ts` file to use this new approach.

Also, I notice there are CSV files in the seed directory. Would you like me to examine their structure to ensure our seeding script matches the data format?

yes strat implementing

_**Assistant**_

I'll start implementing the seeding script. First, let's examine one of the CSV files to understand the data structure.

Now I'll create a new seeding script that handles the data properly. Let me create a new file for this.

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check the other CSV files to implement the remaining seeding functions.

---

Let me add the seeding functions for these tables and fix the linter error. I'll update the script:

---

Now let me check the trial stages and types CSV files to implement their seeding functions.

---

_****_



---

Let me update the script to include the trial stages and types seeding functions:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me fix the linter errors by installing the required dependencies and fixing the query syntax:

---

_****_

_****_



Now let me fix the query syntax for the trial stages types relationship:

---

_****_

_****_



Let me fix the query syntax again using the correct operator:

Now we have a complete seeding script that:

1. Loads data from CSV files
2. Seeds tables in the correct order based on dependencies
3. Maintains relationships between tables
4. Handles duplicate entries
5. Stores IDs for relationship mapping

The script will seed the following tables in order:
1. States (independent)
2. Cities (depends on states, but currently without state mapping)
3. Law Branches (independent)
4. Jurisdictions (independent)
5. Trial Stages (independent)
6. Trial Types (independent)
7. Trial Stages Types (depends on trial stages and types)

Note: Currently, the cities are being seeded without their state relationships. To properly set up these relationships, we would need either:
1. A mapping CSV file that defines which city belongs to which state
2. Or modify the cities CSV to include a state column

Would you like me to:
1. Add state-city mapping functionality
2. Create a mapping CSV file for trial stages and types
3. Or proceed with running the current script?

_**User**_

ok this is great great work thanks, i just updated the cities table with the reference to the state it belongs to, since we dont have ids until they get created in the database i just set the names @reference-cities.csv 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the seeding script to handle the city-state relationships using the new CSV file. Let me check the new CSV file first.

---

I don't see the state references in the CSV file yet. Could you share the updated CSV file with the state references? The file should have a column that indicates which state each city belongs to. This way, we can properly set up the relationships in the database.

The format should be something like:
```csv
id,name,state
,acapulco,guerrero
,aguascalientes,aguascalientes
,boca del río,veracruz
```

Once you provide the updated CSV with state references, I'll modify the seeding script to:
1. First seed all states
2. Store the state IDs in memory
3. When seeding cities, look up the corresponding state ID and set the relationship

Would you like me to help you create this mapping, or do you have an updated CSV file with the state references?

---

_**User**_

done just updated it 

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Now I'll update the seeding script to handle the city-state relationships. I'll modify the `seedCities` function to use the state references:

---

I've updated the seeding script with the following changes:

1. Changed the CSV filename to match the new one (`reference-cities.csv`)
2. Added state relationship handling:
   - Looks up the state ID using the state name from the CSV
   - Adds error handling for cases where the state isn't found
   - Sets the `stateId` when creating new cities
3. Added state ID updating for existing cities:
   - If a city exists but has a different state ID, it will be updated
4. Improved logging to show state information

The script will now:
1. First seed all states and store their IDs in memory
2. When seeding cities, look up the corresponding state ID using the state name
3. Create the city with the proper state relationship
4. Handle cases where cities might need their state relationship updated

Would you like me to also fix the remaining linter error about the missing `postgres` package? We can install it with:
```bash
npm install postgres
```

_**User**_

ok i isntalled it, now how do i run this ? seeding script 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you run the seeding script. First, let's make sure we're in the right directory and then run the script with ts-node.

Now we can run the seeding script. Make sure you have the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable set. Let's create a `.env` file first:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Now let's run the seeding script:

---

_****_



---

_****_



It seems we need to configure ts-node properly. Let's try with the proper flags:

---

_****_



---

_****_







Let's try with npx:

---

_****_



---

_****_







Let's try a different approach. Since this is a TypeScript project with ESM modules, we can use `tsx` instead:

---

_****_



---

_****_







Now let's try running the script with tsx:

---

_****_



---

_****_







It looks like there's an issue with the file paths. Let me fix the file paths in the script:

---

_****_



---

_****_







Now let's try running the script again:

---

_****_

_****_



Great! The seeding script ran successfully. Here's what was seeded:

1. States: All 32 Mexican states were inserted
2. Cities: All cities were inserted with their proper state relationships
3. Law Branches: 17 different law branches were inserted
4. Jurisdictions: Federal and local jurisdictions were inserted
5. Trial Stages: 13 different trial stages were inserted
6. Trial Types: 9 different trial types were inserted
7. Trial Stages Types: All possible combinations of trial stages and types were created (9 types × 13 stages = 117 relationships)

Everything seems to have been seeded correctly. Would you like me to help you verify any specific part of the data or make any adjustments to the seeding process?

_**User**_

this is sick really impressed, i forgot the last one that has reference to almost all tables, the courthouses table, here is the csv so that we can also either create another seeding script or add to the one we have, perhaps it would be best to add to the one we have. 

for the parent id, i input 1 since it would be the first record not sure what to do there 

@reference-courthouses.csv 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the courthouses seeding to our existing script. First, let me check the courthouse schema to understand its structure.

---

_****_

_****_







Now I'll update our seeding script to include the courthouses. I'll add the type and seeding function:

---

_****_

_****_







I've updated the seeding script to include courthouses. Here's what I've added:

1. Added the `CourthouseInsert` type
2. Added a `courthouseIds` map to store courthouse IDs
3. Added the `seedCourthouses` function that:
   - Loads courthouse data from CSV
   - Looks up all required references (state, city, law branch, jurisdiction)
   - Creates or updates courthouse records
   - Handles parent-child relationships
   - Maintains proper foreign key relationships

The script will now:
1. First seed all the base tables (states, cities, law branches, jurisdictions)
2. Then seed the trial-related tables
3. Finally seed the courthouses which depend on all the previous tables

For the parent-child relationship:
- The first record (poder judicial de la federación) will have no parent (null)
- All other records will have parent_id = 1 (as specified in your CSV)

Would you like me to run the updated script to seed the courthouses?

---

_**User**_

ok we are almost there we did got this error for the courthouses, we where only able to seed the first record not the rest of them 

  severity_local: 'ERROR',
  severity: 'ERROR',
  code: '23505',
  detail: 'Key (jurisdiction_id)=(1) already exists.',
  schema_name: 'reference',
  table_name: 'courthouses',
  constraint_name: 'courthouses_jurisdiction_id_unique',
  file: 'nbtinsert.c',
  line: '666',
  routine: '_bt_check_unique'
}

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, I see the issue! Looking at the courthouse schema, we have unique constraints on several fields that shouldn't be unique:

```typescript
cityId: integer("city_id").unique(),
lawBranchId: integer("law_branch_id").unique(),
jurisdictionId: integer("jurisdiction_id").unique(),
stateId: integer("state_id").unique(),
```

These unique constraints mean that each city, law branch, jurisdiction, and state can only be associated with one courthouse, which is not what we want. Multiple courthouses can be in the same city, have the same law branch, etc.

Let me fix this by updating the courthouse schema first:

Now we need to apply this schema change to the database. Let me check if there's a migration script we can use.
