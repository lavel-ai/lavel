# Data Flow Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how data flows through the Lavel AI platform, from user interactions to database operations and back to the UI, utilizing React 19's modern patterns.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Server-Centric Data Fetching**: Initial data is fetched on the server using Server Components
2. **Action-Driven Mutations**: Data mutations use React 19's Actions for automatic pending states and error handling
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with useOptimistic for a seamless user experience
4. **Tenant Isolation**: All data operations respect tenant boundaries
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the data flow
6. **Multi-level Caching**: Caching at server, client, and database levels improves performance

## Data Flow Layers

The Lavel AI platform implements a layered approach to data flow:

### 1. User Interface Layer
- **Server Components**: Render on the server with direct database access
- **Client Components**: Handle user interactions and state updates
- **Document Metadata**: Manage title, meta tags, and links within components

### 2. Data Management Layer
- **Server Actions**: Handle data operations on the server with automatic pending states
- **Action State**: Manage action states with useActionState for forms
- **Optimistic Updates**: Provide immediate feedback with useOptimistic

### 3. Service Layer
- **API Services**: Abstractions for data operations
- **Normalization Pipeline**: Ensures data quality and consistency

### 4. Database Layer
- **Tenant Database**: Isolated database per tenant
- **Query Functions**: Encapsulate database operations

## Request Flow

A typical data request flows through the system as follows:

1. **Initial Page Load**:
   - User accesses a tenant URL (e.g., `mg.lavel.ai/cases`)
   - Authentication middleware validates the session
   - Server Components fetch initial data via Server Actions
   - HTML with data is sent to the browser
   - Stylesheets and scripts are automatically managed with proper loading priorities

2. **Form Submissions**:
   - Forms use the action prop with Server Actions
   - Pending states are managed automatically
   - Error states are captured and returned
   - Forms reset automatically on success

3. **Interactive Updates**:
   - Optimistic updates provide immediate UI feedback
   - Server Actions process changes on the server
   - The UI automatically reverts on error

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Several cross-cutting concerns are integrated throughout the data flow:

### Authentication and Authorization
- Clerk provides authentication services
- Tenant routing ensures users access only their organization's data
- Authentication utilities reduce boilerplate in Server Actions

### Error Handling and Tracking
- Error feedback is integrated directly into Actions
- Error states are managed with useActionState
- Error boundaries provide graceful degradation

### Metadata and Resource Management
- Document metadata (title, meta tags) are managed within components
- Stylesheets are automatically loaded with correct precedence
- Resource preloading APIs optimize page performance

## Data Flow Guidelines

When implementing data flow in the Lavel AI platform, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Server Components for Initial Data**: Fetch initial page data on the server using Server Components
2. **Use Server Actions for Data Operations**: Implement data mutations as Server Actions with automatic state handling
3. **Implement Form Submissions with action prop**: Use the form action prop for automatic form handling
4. **Use useOptimistic for Immediate Feedback**: Provide optimistic updates for a better user experience
5. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Leverage Action error states for comprehensive error management
6. **Respect Tenant Isolation**: All data operations must respect tenant boundaries
