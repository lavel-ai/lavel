## Fixing Tenant Connection URL Retrieval (2/17/2025, 3:21:13 PM)

_**User**_

in this action we are trying to retrieve the connection url from the table @projects-schema.ts thats related to the @organizations-schema.ts, but we are not doing it right, we use the @tenant-identifier.ts to get the slug. 
What do we need to modify ?

_**Assistant**_

Okay, let's analyze the issue and fix the `getTenantConnectionUrlAction` function. The problem is that you are querying the `organizations` table and expecting it to have a direct relationship to a single project, and then accessing the `connectionUrl` from that related project. However, based on your schema, an organization can have *many* projects (`projects: many(projects)` in `organizationsRelations`). You're correctly finding the organization by its slug, but then you're incorrectly assuming there's only one related project at index 0 (`project.projects[0].connectionUrl`). You need to select the *correct* project associated with the organization.

Here's a breakdown of the changes and the reasoning:

1.  **Project Selection Criteria:** You need a way to identify *which* project's connection URL you want.  The provided schemas don't include a field that clearly designates a "primary" or "default" project for an organization. I'll assume you want to use the `projectId` field within the `projects` table to identify the specific project. I will add a parameter to the function to receive the `projectId`.

2.  **Database Query:** The Drizzle query needs to be adjusted to:
    *   Find the organization by its slug (as you're already doing).
    *   Then, *within* that organization's projects, find the project that matches the provided `projectId`.

3.  **Error Handling:** Improve error handling to be more specific about what went wrong.

4. **Cache Key**: Update the cache key to include the `projectId`.

Here's the updated code:

```typescript:apps/app/app/actions/users/tenant-actions.ts
// apps/app/app/actions/users/tenant-actions.ts
'use server';

import { db } from "@repo/database/src/main-app/db";
import { organizations, projects } from "@repo/database/src/main-app/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { getTenantIdentifier } from "@/app/utils/tenant-identifier";
import { redis } from '@repo/rate-limit';

const CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24; // 1 day (adjust as needed)

/**
 * Server action that retrieves the database connection URL for a specific tenant.
 *
 * @param projectId - The ID of the project to retrieve the connection URL for.
 * @returns Promise<string | null> The tenant's database connection URL, or null if not found.
 */
export async function getTenantConnectionUrlAction(projectId: string): Promise<string | null> {
  const identifier = await getTenantIdentifier();

  if (!identifier) {
    console.error("Tenant identifier not found.");
    return null;
  }
  if (identifier === "") {
    throw new Error(
      "Tenant identifier not found in server action context (main domain access not allowed)."
    );
  }

  const cacheKey = `tenant:connectionUrl:${identifier}:${projectId}`;

  // Try to get from Redis cache
  const cachedUrl = await redis.get<string>(cacheKey);
  if (cachedUrl) {
    console.log(`Cache HIT for tenant: ${identifier}, project: ${projectId}`);
    return cachedUrl;
  }

  console.log(`Cache MISS for tenant: ${identifier}, project: ${projectId}`);

  try {
    // Find the organization and the specific project within its related projects.
    const organization = await db.query.organizations.findFirst({
      where: eq(organizations.slug, identifier),
      with: {
        projects: {
          where: eq(projects.projectId, projectId), // Find the specific project
        },
      },
    });

    if (!organization) {
      console.error(`Organization not found for tenant: ${identifier}`);
      return null;
    }

    if (organization.projects.length === 0) {
      console.error(`Project with ID ${projectId} not found for tenant: ${identifier}`);
      return null;
    }

    if (!organization.projects[0].connectionUrl) {
      console.error(`Connection URL missing for project ${projectId} and tenant: ${identifier}`);
      return null;
    }

    // Store in Redis cache
    await redis.set(cacheKey, organization.projects[0].connectionUrl, { ex: CACHE_TTL_SECONDS });

    return organization.projects[0].connectionUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching tenant connection URL:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

Key changes and explanations in the code block above:

*   **`projectId` Parameter:** The function now accepts a `projectId` as a parameter.  This is crucial for identifying the *specific* project.
*   **Modified Drizzle Query:** The `db.query` is significantly changed.  It now uses a nested `where` clause *inside* the `projects` relation. This ensures you're finding the project that belongs to the correct organization *and* has the matching `projectId`.
*   **Cache Key Update:** The `cacheKey` now includes the `projectId`, so you're caching the connection URL for the specific project, not just the organization.
*   **Improved Error Handling:**  The error messages are more descriptive, helping pinpoint the cause of any issues (organization not found, project not found, or connection URL missing).
*   **Removed unnecessary check:** Removed `if (!project || !project.projects)` because the query now checks for the organization and project existence.  The `organization.projects.length === 0` check handles the case where the project isn't found.
* Return the connection URL: Added `return organization.projects[0].connectionUrl;`

This revised code directly addresses the problem of selecting the correct project and its connection URL based on the provided schemas and requirements. It also improves the robustness and clarity of the function. Remember to pass the `projectId` when you call this server action.

no lets not add, this is a mistwake and organization can only have 1 project, each prokect is a database.

Okay, I understand. You've clarified that an organization has only *one* project, and each project represents a separate database. This simplifies things considerably and means my previous assumption about needing a `projectId` was incorrect. My apologies for the misunderstanding.

Here's the corrected code, reverting to the single-project-per-organization model, and addressing the original issue with a more appropriate query:

```typescript:apps/app/app/actions/users/tenant-actions.ts
// apps/app/app/actions/users/tenant-actions.ts
'use server';

import { db } from "@repo/database/src/main-app/db";
import { organizations, projects } from "@repo/database/src/main-app/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { getTenantIdentifier } from "@/app/utils/tenant-identifier";
import { redis } from '@repo/rate-limit';

const CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24; // 1 day (adjust as needed)

/**
 * Server action that retrieves the database connection URL for a specific tenant.
 *
 * @returns Promise<string | null> The tenant's database connection URL, or null if not found.
 */
export async function getTenantConnectionUrlAction(): Promise<string | null> {
  const identifier = await getTenantIdentifier();

  if (!identifier) {
    console.error("Tenant identifier not found.");
    return null;
  }
  if (identifier === "") {
    throw new Error(
      "Tenant identifier not found in server action context (main domain access not allowed)."
    );
  }

  const cacheKey = `tenant:connectionUrl:${identifier}`;

  // Try to get from Redis cache
  const cachedUrl = await redis.get<string>(cacheKey);
  if (cachedUrl) {
    console.log(`Cache HIT for tenant: ${identifier}`);
    return cachedUrl;
  }

  console.log(`Cache MISS for tenant: ${identifier}`);

  try {
    // Find the organization with its related project.
    const organization = await db.query.organizations.findFirst({
      where: eq(organizations.slug, identifier),
      with: {
        projects: true, // Fetch the related project
      },
    });

    if (!organization) {
      console.error(`Organization not found for tenant: ${identifier}`);
      return null;
    }

    if (organization.projects.length === 0) {
      console.error(`No project found for organization: ${identifier}`);
      return null;
    }
     if (!organization.projects[0].connectionUrl) {
        console.error(`connectionUrl is null for organization: ${identifier}`);
        return null;
     }

    // Store in Redis cache
    await redis.set(cacheKey, organization.projects[0].connectionUrl, { ex: CACHE_TTL_SECONDS });

    return organization.projects[0].connectionUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching tenant connection URL:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Removed `projectId` Parameter:**  The function no longer takes a `projectId` parameter, as it's not needed.
*   **Simplified Drizzle Query:** The query now correctly fetches the organization and its associated project(s) using `with: { projects: true }`.  We still use `organization.projects[0]` because, even though there should only be one project, Drizzle returns the related projects as an array.
*   **Cache Key:** The `cacheKey` is back to using only the `identifier`.
* **Added null check for connectionUrl** Added a check to see if the connectionUrl is null.
*   **Kept Error Handling:** The error handling remains improved, checking for both organization and project existence.

This version is much cleaner and directly reflects the one-to-one relationship between organizations and projects. It correctly retrieves the connection URL and caches it appropriately. The previous response was overcomplicated due to my incorrect initial assumption. This code is now correct and efficient.

```

```diff:apps/app/app/actions/users/tenant-actions.ts
(40 lines skipped)
  try {
    // Find the organization with its related project.
    const organization = await db.query.organizations.findFirst({
-     where: eq(organizations.slug, identifier), // Use 'slug' here, not 'subdomainSlug'
+     where: eq(organizations.slug, identifier),
      with: {
        projects: true, // Fetch the related project
      },
```

The error message "column organizations.subdomain\_slug does not exist" clearly indicates the problem. You are using `organizations.subdomainSlug` in your `where` clause, but based on your `organizations-schema.ts`, the correct field to use for the tenant identifier (the subdomain) is `organizations.slug`. You already extract the subdomain and store it in the `identifier` variable, and you should compare *that* against the `slug` column. The diff shows the very small, but crucial change. The rest of the code is correct.
