## Package Path Troubleshooting (2/28/2025, 6:20:18 AM)

_**User**_

@README.md i created this new package @package.json but it is not currently working the path what do i need to do? 

Cannot find module '@repo/schema/utils/normalize' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is having an issue with importing from the `@repo/schema/utils/normalize` path, which can't be found by TypeScript. Let's analyze what's needed to fix this issue.

From the provided files:

1. We have a `packages/schema/package.json` that defines a package named `@repo/schema`.
2. We have a department form component that tries to import from `@repo/schema/utils/normalize`.
3. We have a readme for the schema package that describes the architecture and structure, but it seems this is more of a future plan than the current state.

Based on the error, the file path `packages/schema/src/utils/normalize.ts` likely doesn't exist yet, but it's being referenced in `department-form.tsx`.

Here's what I need to do:

1. Check if the directory structure exists
2. Create the necessary file(s) if they don't exist
3. Implement the normalize utility as described in the README

Let's look at what's being imported specifically:
```typescript
import { normalizeText } from '@repo/schema/utils/normalize';
```

This function is expected to have methods like `titleCase` and `trim` which are used in the department form component.

Since it seems this is a schema package related to data normalization, I'll need to create the missing file(s) with the functionality described in the README.</think>I can see the issue. You've created the package `@repo/schema` but you're missing the actual implementation of the `normalize.ts` utility that's being referenced in your department form. Let's create the necessary directory structure and files to resolve this error.

First, let's check if the directory structure exists:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/schema • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |

</details>

Now let's check if the `src/utils` directory exists:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/schema/src • **10** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `pipeline` |
| 📁 `entities` |
| 📁 `evolution` |
| 📁 `resilience` |
| 📄 `index.ts` |
| 📁 `config` |
| 📁 `events` |
| 📁 `utils` |
| 📄 `registry.ts` |
| 📁 `monitoring` |

</details>

Let's check what's in the utils directory:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory packages/schema/src/utils • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `client.ts` |
| 📄 `normalize.ts` |

</details>

Interesting! The `normalize.ts` file already exists, but the error suggests it's not being correctly recognized by the import system. Let's examine its contents:

---

_****_

Read file: packages/schema/src/utils/normalize.ts

---

_****_



Let's check if the main `index.ts` file exports these utilities:

---

_****_

Read file: packages/schema/src/index.ts

---

_****_





Based on my analysis, the `normalize.ts` file exists and is properly exported from the package. Let's check how it's imported in the department form:

---

_****_

Read file: apps/app/app/(authenticated)/features/department/components/department-form.tsx

---

_****_





The issue likely revolves around the path in the import. Let's fix it by updating the import path in the department form to match the package structure.

The key issue here appears to be that we're importing from `@repo/schema/utils/normalize` but the actual path according to the package structure should be just `@repo/schema` since the `index.ts` file is already exporting everything.

Let's make the fix:
