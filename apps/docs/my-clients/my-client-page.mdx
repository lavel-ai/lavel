# My Firm Page Architecture

## Overview
The My Firm page is a comprehensive dashboard for managing a law firm's teams, lawyers, and clients. It follows Next.js 14 App Router architecture with React Server Components (RSC) for optimal performance and data fetching.

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **teams**
   - Primary information about legal teams
   - Fields: id, name, description, practiceArea, department
   - Soft delete pattern with deletedAt

2. **profiles**
   - Lawyer/staff member information
   - Fields: id, userId, name, lastName, maternalLastName, practiceArea, isLeadLawyer
   - Connected to auth system via userId

3. **team_profiles**
   - Junction table connecting teams and profiles
   - Fields: id, teamId, profileId, role
   - Ensures unique team membership

## Component Architecture

### Page Layer
```
/app/(authenticated)/my-firm/
├── page.tsx              # Server Component - Data fetching
├── my-firm-content.tsx   # Client Component - UI and interactivity
└── components/           # Feature-specific components
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
MyFirmPage (Server)
├── Header (Client)
│   └── Breadcrumb Navigation
└── MyFirmContent (Client)
    ├── Tabs
    │   ├── Lawyers Tab
    │   │   ├── Teams Section
    │   │   │   ├── TeamCard
    │   │   │   └── CreateTeamDialog
    │   │   └── Lawyers Section
    │   │       └── LawyerCard
    │   └── Clients Tab
    │       ├── ClientsTable (Desktop)
    │       └── ClientCard (Mobile)
```

## Data Flow

### Server Actions
1. **Team Management**
   - `getTeams()`: Fetch teams with member information
   - `createTeam()`: Create new team
   - `updateTeam()`: Update team details
   - `deleteTeam()`: Soft delete team

2. **Lawyer Management**
   - `getLawyers()`: Fetch all lawyers/profiles
   - `updateLawyer()`: Update lawyer information
   - `assignToTeam()`: Manage team membership

### State Management
- Server state managed through React Server Components
- UI state (tabs, dialogs) managed locally in client components
- Mobile/responsive state managed through design system provider

## Features and Implementation

### Teams Section
- Display teams in grid layout
- Show team members with avatar stack
- Team creation through dialog/drawer
- Team editing capabilities (planned)

### Lawyers Section
- Display lawyers in grid layout
- Show key information: name, role, team, practice area
- Profile editing capabilities (planned)

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Grid layouts, full tables
- Mobile: Single column, cards instead of tables
- Drawer for mobile forms, dialog for desktop

## Security and Access Control

### RBAC Implementation (Planned)
- Team management permissions
- Lawyer profile editing permissions
- Client data access permissions

## Error Handling and Loading States

### Implementation Plan
1. Loading skeletons for:
   - Team cards
   - Lawyer cards
   - Client table/cards
2. Error boundaries for:
   - Data fetching failures
   - Form submission errors
3. Optimistic updates for:
   - Team creation
   - Team member assignment

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Advanced team management
   - Team hierarchy
   - Sub-teams
   - Team performance metrics

2. Enhanced lawyer profiles
   - Skill tracking
   - Case history
   - Availability status

3. Client management
   - Client onboarding
   - Matter tracking
   - Billing integration

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for interactivity
- Shared UI components from design system
- Type-safe database queries with Drizzle

### Performance Considerations
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Proper error boundary implementation
- Efficient data fetching patterns

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for:
   - Server actions
   - UI components
   - Form validation

2. Integration tests for:
   - Team creation flow
   - Lawyer assignment
   - Client management

3. E2E tests for critical paths:
   - Team creation and management
   - Lawyer profile updates
   - Client data handling
