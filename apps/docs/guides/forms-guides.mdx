# Lavel AI Form Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

The Lavel AI Form Architecture is a standardized system for building, validating, and processing forms throughout our application. 
It replaces ad-hoc form implementations with a unified approach that handles data validation, normalization, analytics tracking, and error management consistently across all forms.

This architecture addresses several critical challenges:

1. **Reducing Boilerplate Code**: Previous form implementations required extensive repetitive code for validation, normalization, and error handling. Our new architecture reduces this by up to 70%.

2. **Ensuring Data Quality**: By centralizing normalization and validation logic, we ensure consistent data cleaning and format standardization across all forms.

3. **Simplifying Analytics**: Rather than manually adding analytics tracking to each form, standardized tracking is built into the architecture.

4. **Improving Error Handling**: The architecture provides consistent, user-friendly error messages and validation feedback.

5. **Supporting Multi-tenant Isolation**: All form processing respects tenant boundaries, ensuring data is properly isolated.

This documentation explains how to use this architecture to create forms of varying complexity while maintaining consistency and reducing development effort.

## Schema Flow

Data flows through our form architecture in the following sequence:

1. **User Input**: The user enters data into form fields, which may have client-side normalization applied as they type or when fields lose focus.

2. **Form Submission**: When the user submits the form, React's form action is invoked with the form data.

3. **Server Action Processing**: The server action:
   - Authenticates the user and establishes tenant context
   - Extracts form data
   - Passes data to the form pipeline

4. **Data Pipeline Processing**: The data flows through a four-stage pipeline:
   - **Sanitization**: Removes potentially harmful content
   - **Normalization**: Standardizes data formats (e.g., title case for names)
   - **Validation**: Verifies data against schema requirements
   - **Monitoring**: Calculates data quality metrics

5. **Database Operation**: If validation succeeds, the data is saved to the database with appropriate tenant isolation.

6. **Response Handling**: The server action returns the result to the client, including any validation errors or normalization changes.

7. **UI Updates**: The form component updates to show success, errors, or normalization feedback.

8. **Analytics Tracking**: Throughout this process, analytics events are automatically tracked.

## Architecture Description

### Core Architecture Principles

Our form architecture is built on several key principles:

1. **Centralized Schema Registry**: All entity schemas are registered in a central location with their validation and normalization rules.

2. **Standardized Processing Pipeline**: All form data follows the same processing pipeline, ensuring consistent handling.

3. **Component-Based Form Elements**: Specialized form components handle normalization and validation feedback.

4. **Automatic Analytics Integration**: Form analytics are tracked automatically at key points in the form lifecycle.

5. **Factory Pattern For Reusability**: Form pipelines and server actions are created through factories to reduce boilerplate.

### Why This Approach?

We chose this architecture for several compelling reasons:

1. **Development Efficiency**: Developers can create new forms in a fraction of the time previously required by leveraging standard components and factories.

2. **Consistency**: All forms behave consistently, improving user experience and reducing bugs.

3. **Maintainability**: Changes to validation or normalization logic can be made in one place and affect all forms.

4. **Scalability**: The architecture starts simple but can scale to handle complex forms with relationships.

5. **Analytics Integration**: Automatic analytics tracking provides insights into form usage and conversion rates without additional development effort.

### How It Works

The architecture integrates several components:

1. **Schema Registry**: Stores entity schemas with validation and normalization rules.

2. **Form Pipeline Factory**: Creates data processing pipelines for forms based on schemas.

3. **Form Processing Hook**: Manages form state, including pending states, errors, and analytics.

4. **Server Action Factory**: Creates server actions that handle authentication, data processing, and database operations.

5. **Normalized Form Components**: Provide built-in normalization and validation feedback.

These components work together to provide a consistent pattern for form creation, validation, and processing.

## File Descriptions

### Schema Registry Enhancement (packages/schema/src/registry.ts)

This file enhances the existing schema registry to support form-specific configuration:

- **SchemaInfo Type**: Extended to include field-level configuration for normalization.
- **registerEntitySchema Method**: New method that infers normalization configuration from schema types.
- **get Method**: Retrieves schemas and their associated configurations.

The registry serves as the single source of truth for entity schemas and their validation/normalization rules.

### Form Pipeline Factory (packages/schema/src/form/create-form-pipeline.ts)

This file provides a factory for creating form processing pipelines:

- **createFormPipeline Function**: Creates a standardized pipeline for form data processing.
- **sanitizeData Function**: Applies sanitization rules based on schema configuration.
- **normalizeData Function**: Applies normalization rules to standardize data formats.
- **validateData Function**: Validates data against the schema with configurable resilience.
- **monitorData Function**: Monitors data quality metrics.

The pipeline ensures consistent data processing across all forms in the application.

### Form Processing Hook (apps/app/app/hooks/use-form-processor.ts)

This client-side hook manages form state and interactions:

- **useFormProcessor Hook**: Leverages React 19's useActionState for form handling.
- **Analytics Integration**: Tracks form view, submission, and abandonment.
- **Success and Error Callbacks**: Provides customizable handling for form outcomes.
- **State Management**: Manages pending states, success/error states, and normalization changes.

This hook simplifies form component implementation and ensures consistent behavior.

### Server Action Factory (apps/app/app/actions/form/create-form-action.ts)

This factory creates server actions with standardized behavior:

- **createFormAction Function**: Creates a server action with standard processing.
- **Data Pipeline Integration**: Processes form data through the pipeline.
- **Analytics Tracking**: Records form submission outcomes and entity operations.
- **Error Handling**: Provides consistent error handling with Sentry integration.
- **Redirect and Revalidation**: Handles success redirects and page revalidation.

This factory eliminates repetitive server action code while ensuring consistent processing.

### Authentication Utility (apps/app/app/utils/with-auth.ts) 

This utility provides authentication for server actions:

- **withFormAuth Function**: Wraps server actions with authentication and tenant context.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and reports authentication failures.
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensures proper tenant context for database operations.

This utility ensures all form operations are properly authenticated and tenant-aware.

### Normalized Form Components (packages/design-system/components/form/*.tsx)

These components provide standardized form inputs with built-in normalization:

- **NormalizedInput Component**: Text input with configurable normalization.
- **NormalizedTextarea Component**: Multi-line input with normalization.
- **Normalization Feedback**: Shows changes made during normalization.
- **Error Display**: Consistently displays validation errors.

These components ensure a consistent user experience across all forms.

### Form Analytics (packages/analytics/form-analytics.ts)

This file provides unified analytics tracking for forms:

- **useFormAnalytics Hook**: Client-side hook for tracking form interactions.
- **trackFormEvent Function**: Server-side function for tracking form outcomes.
- **Standardized Events**: Consistent event names and properties for analytics.

This ensures comprehensive analytics data collection for all forms without duplicating tracking code.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Form

### 1. Define Your Entity Schema

Start by defining your entity schema with validation and normalization rules:

```typescript
// packages/schema/src/entities/project.ts
import { z } from 'zod';
import { schemaRegistry } from '../registry';

export const projectSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  status: z.enum(['active', 'completed', 'on-hold']).default('active'),
  dueDate: z.string().optional(),
});

// Register with automatic configuration
schemaRegistry.registerEntitySchema({
  name: 'project',
  schema: projectSchema,
  config: {
    name: { trim: true, titleCase: true },
    description: { trim: true, sanitizeHtml: true },
  }
});

export type Project = z.infer<typeof projectSchema>;
```

### 2. Create a Server Action

Create a server action for your form using the factory:

```typescript
// app/(authenticated)/features/projects/actions/project-actions.ts
'use server';

import { createFormAction } from '@repo/schema/src/actions';
import { withFormAuth } from '@repo/schema/src/actions/with-auth';

export const createProject = withFormAuth(
  createFormAction({
    entityType: 'project',
    dbOperation: async (db, data, user) => {
      // Insert into database
      return db.insert(db.projects).values({
        ...data,
        createdBy: user.id
      });
    },
    successRedirect: (result) => `/projects/${result.id}`,
    revalidatePaths: ['/projects'],
  })
);
```

### 3. Create a Form Component

Create a client component that uses the form processing hook:

```tsx
// app/(authenticated)/features/projects/components/project-form.tsx
'use client';

import { useFormProcessor } from '@repo/schema/src/hooks';
import { NormalizedInput, NormalizedTextarea } from '@repo/design-system/components/form';
import { Button } from '@repo/design-system/components/ui/button';
import { createProject } from '../actions/project-actions';

export function ProjectForm() {
  const {
    formAction,
    isPending,
    actionState,
    error,
    changes,
  } = useFormProcessor({
    entityType: 'project',
    serverAction: createProject,
    analytics: {
      formType: 'project_creation',
    },
  });
  
  return (
    <form action={formAction} className="space-y-4">
      <NormalizedInput
        name="name"
        label="Project Name"
        normalize="titleCase"
        required
        error={actionState?.fieldErrors?.name}
      />
      
      <NormalizedTextarea
        name="description"
        label="Description"
        error={actionState?.fieldErrors?.description}
      />
      
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <label htmlFor="status">Status</label>
        <select id="status" name="status" defaultValue="active">
          <option value="active">Active</option>
          <option value="completed">Completed</option>
          <option value="on-hold">On Hold</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      
      <NormalizedInput
        name="dueDate"
        label="Due Date"
        type="date"
        error={actionState?.fieldErrors?.dueDate}
      />
      
      <Button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Project'}
      </Button>
      
      {error && (
        <div className="text-red-500">{error}</div>
      )}
      
      {changes && changes.length > 0 && (
        <div className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          <p>The following fields were normalized:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
            {changes.map((change, index) => (
              <li key={index}>
                <strong>{change.field}:</strong> "{change.original}" → "{change.normalized}"
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 4. Add the Form to a Page

Add your form component to a page:

```tsx
// app/(authenticated)/projects/new/page.tsx
import { ProjectForm } from '../components/project-form';

export default function NewProjectPage() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Create New Project</h1>
      <ProjectForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! Your form now has:
- Validation with friendly error messages
- Data normalization with user feedback
- Loading states during submission
- Analytics tracking for user interactions
- Proper error handling and reporting

## Complex Form Approach

For more complex forms with relationships (like clients with addresses and contacts), the architecture can be extended:

### 1. Define Related Schemas

Define schemas for both parent and child entities:

```typescript
// Partial example for client with addresses
import { z } from 'zod';
import { schemaRegistry } from '../registry';

// Define address schema
export const addressSchema = z.object({
  street: z.string().min(1, "Street is required"),
  city: z.string().min(1, "City is required"),
  // Other fields...
});

// Define client schema with addresses relationship
export const clientSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  // Other client fields...
  addresses: z.array(addressSchema).optional(),
});

// Register schemas
schemaRegistry.registerEntitySchema({
  name: 'address',
  schema: addressSchema,
  // Configuration...
});

schemaRegistry.registerEntitySchema({
  name: 'client',
  schema: clientSchema,
  // Configuration...
});
```

### 2. Create Collection Components

Create components for managing collections of related entities:

```tsx
// Example address collection component
function AddressCollection({ addresses, onChange }) {
  const addAddress = () => {
    onChange([...addresses, { street: '', city: '', state: '', zipCode: '' }]);
  };
  
  const updateAddress = (index, newAddress) => {
    const newAddresses = [...addresses];
    newAddresses[index] = newAddress;
    onChange(newAddresses);
  };
  
  const removeAddress = (index) => {
    onChange(addresses.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Addresses</h3>
      
      {addresses.map((address, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="border p-4 rounded">
          <div className="flex justify-end">
            <button 
              type="button"
              onClick={() => removeAddress(index)}
              className="text-red-500"
            >
              Remove
            </button>
          </div>
          
          <NormalizedInput
            name={`addresses[${index}].street`}
            label="Street"
            value={address.street}
            onChange={(e) => updateAddress(index, { ...address, street: e.target.value })}
          />
          
          {/* Other address fields */}
        </div>
      ))}
      
      <button 
        type="button"
        onClick={addAddress}
        className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded"
      >
        Add Address
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Create a Complex Form Processor

Use state management to handle the complex form:

```tsx
function ClientForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    addresses: [],
    contacts: []
  });
  
  const {
    formAction,
    isPending,
    actionState,
  } = useFormProcessor({
    entityType: 'client',
    serverAction: createClient,
    initialData: formData,
  });
  
  // Handle form submission with the complete data structure
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    // The form processor will handle the submission with the full data structure
    formAction(new FormData(e.target));
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Client fields */}
      <NormalizedInput
        name="name"
        label="Client Name"
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, name: e.target.value })}
      />
      
      {/* Address collection */}
      <AddressCollection
        addresses={formData.addresses}
        onChange={(addresses) => setFormData({ ...formData, addresses })}
      />
      
      {/* Contact collection (similar to address collection) */}
      
      <Button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Client'}
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 4. Create a Transaction-Aware Server Action

Implement a server action that handles multiple related entities:

```typescript
export const createClient = withFormAuth(
  createFormAction({
    entityType: 'client',
    dbOperation: async (db, data, user) => {
      // Extract addresses and contacts from the data
      const { addresses = [], contacts = [], ...clientData } = data;
      
      // Use a transaction for atomic operations
      return db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
        // Create the client
        const clientResult = await tx.insert(db.clients).values({
          ...clientData,
          createdBy: user.id
        });
        
        const clientId = clientResult.id;
        
        // Create addresses
        const addressPromises = addresses.map(async (addressData) => {
          const addressResult = await tx.insert(db.addresses).values({
            ...addressData,
            createdBy: user.id
          });
          
          // Create client-address relationship
          await tx.insert(db.clientAddresses).values({
            clientId,
            addressId: addressResult.id,
            createdBy: user.id
          });
          
          return addressResult;
        });
        
        // Create contacts (similar to addresses)
        const contactPromises = contacts.map(async (contactData) => {
          // Similar to address creation
        });
        
        // Wait for all operations to complete
        const [addressResults, contactResults] = await Promise.all([
          Promise.all(addressPromises),
          Promise.all(contactPromises)
        ]);
        
        // Return the complete result
        return {
          ...clientResult,
          addresses: addressResults,
          contacts: contactResults
        };
      });
    },
    // Other options...
  })
);
```

This approach maintains the benefits of our architecture while extending it to handle complex relationships.

## Best Practices

### Schema Definition

1. **Use Descriptive Field Names**: Choose clear, descriptive names that indicate the purpose of each field.

2. **Define Explicit Validation Rules**: Include clear validation messages that guide users in correcting inputs.

3. **Specify Normalization Rules**: Define how data should be normalized (e.g., titleCase for names, lowercase for emails).

4. **Document Special Constraints**: Add comments to explain complex validation rules or business requirements.

### Form Components

1. **Group Related Fields**: Organize forms into logical sections using fieldsets or dividers.

2. **Provide Clear Labels**: Use descriptive labels and help text to guide users.

3. **Show Normalization Feedback**: Always show users how their input was changed, especially for sensitive fields.

4. **Use Appropriate Input Types**: Choose the right input type for each field (e.g., email, date).

5. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**: Show complex fields only when needed based on previous answers.

### Server Actions

1. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Ensure all errors are properly caught and reported.

2. **Use Transactions for Related Entities**: Wrap operations on multiple tables in transactions.

3. **Validate Permissions**: Check that users have permission to create/update the entity.

4. **Return Meaningful Results**: Provide detailed success/error information to the client.

### Data Quality

1. **Validate Early, Validate Often**: Apply client-side validation before submission when possible.

2. **Normalize Consistently**: Apply the same normalization rules across all forms.

3. **Monitor Data Quality**: Use the data quality metrics to identify problematic forms.

4. **Review Validation Errors**: Regularly review common validation errors to improve form design.

### Performance

1. **Optimize Large Forms**: Break very large forms into multi-step processes.

2. **Implement Field-Level Validation**: Validate fields as users complete them, not just on submission.

3. **Use Optimistic Updates**: Show success UI before server confirmation for better perceived performance.

### Accessibility

1. **Ensure Keyboard Navigation**: Make sure all form controls are keyboard accessible.

2. **Provide Error Contexts**: Place error messages close to the fields they relate to.

3. **Use ARIA Attributes**: Add appropriate ARIA roles and attributes for screen readers.

4. **Test with Assistive Technologies**: Verify forms work with screen readers and other assistive tools.

By following these practices, you'll create forms that are consistent, maintainable, and provide an excellent user experience.
