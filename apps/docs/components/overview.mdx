# Component Architecture

Lavel AI follows a component-based architecture organized by feature. Each feature contains:

features/
feature-name/
components/ # UI components
hooks/ # Custom React hooks
context/ # Context providers
utils/ # Helper functions
types/ # TypeScript types


## Component Types

We distinguish between several types of components:

### UI Components

Presentational components focused on rendering the user interface.

### Container Components

Components that connect to state and services, then pass data to UI components.

### Feature Components

Larger components that compose multiple UI components to create a complete feature.

### Page Components

Top-level components that represent entire pages in the application.
