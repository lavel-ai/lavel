# Lavel AI Architecture

Lavel AI is built as a multi-tenant SaaS platform for legal professionals in Mexico, with strong isolation between tenants (law firms). The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns.

## System Context

The Lavel AI platform serves multiple law firms, each accessing their own isolated workspace through a unique subdomain. The platform integrates with external services for authentication, payment processing, and email communication.

## Architectural Layers

Our architecture consists of five primary layers:

### UI Layer
The presentation layer built with React components that users directly interact with.

### State Management Layer
Centralizes data handling using React Query for server state and context/Zustand for UI state.

### Service Layer
Provides API interfaces for features to interact with backend data and processes.

### Normalization Layer
Ensures data quality and consistency through a transform pipeline.

### Database Layer
Stores tenant data in isolated PostgreSQL databases via Neon.

## Supporting Components

Beyond the core layers, the architecture includes:

- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and error tracking
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **Feature Flags**: Controlled feature rollout
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Synchronization for multi-user editing
