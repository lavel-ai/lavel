# Problem: Combobox Scrolling Issue in Nested Components

The issue occurs when using a combobox (or any component that uses a popover) inside another component, especially those with their own scrolling context (like cards, modals, or custom scrollable containers). The main symptoms are:

1. The combobox dropdown doesn't scroll properly.
2. The dropdown might appear in unexpected positions.
3. The dropdown might be cut off or not fully visible.

## Why This Happens

- By default, popovers (used internally by comboboxes) are rendered at the root of the DOM tree.
- This can cause conflicts with nested scrolling contexts and positioning.
- The popover might not respect the boundaries of its parent container.

## Solution Guide

### 1. Understand the Component Structure

1. Identify which component is using a popover (e.g., Combobox, Select, DatePicker).
2. Determine where this component is being used (e.g., inside a Card, Modal, or custom scrollable `div`).

---

### 2. Modify the Popover Component

#### a. Locate the Popover component in your combobox implementation.
#### b. Add the `modal={true}` prop to the Popover:

```tsx
<Popover open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} modal={true}>
```

- This ensures the popover content is rendered in a portal, improving `z-index` stacking and positioning.

---

### 3. Adjust the `PopoverContent`

#### a. Find the `PopoverContent` component within your combobox.
#### b. Add the `align="start"` prop:

```tsx
<PopoverContent className="your-classes" align="start">
```

- This helps align the popover correctly with its trigger element.

---

### 4. Check for CSS Interference

#### a. Inspect the parent components of your combobox.
#### b. Look for CSS properties that might interfere with positioning, such as:

- `overflow: hidden`
- `position: relative` or `position: absolute`

#### c. Adjust these properties if necessary, or consider using a CSS reset for the popover container.

---

### 5. Handle Special Cases (if steps 2-4 don't fully resolve the issue)

#### a. For components inside modals or drawers:

- Use React's `createPortal` to render the combobox outside the modal's DOM tree.

Example:

```tsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function ModalWithCombobox() {
  return (
    <Modal>
      {ReactDOM.createPortal(
        <YourComboboxComponent />,
        document.body
      )}
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

#### b. For complex layouts requiring manual positioning:

- Use a positioning library like `@floating-ui/react` for advanced cases.
- Calculate and set the position of the popover manually based on the trigger element's position.

---

### 6. Test Thoroughly

- Test the combobox in various nested scenarios (cards, modals, sidebars, etc.).
- Verify scrolling works correctly in all cases.
- Check for any visual glitches or positioning issues.

---

### 7. Create a Higher-Order Component (Optional)

- If you find yourself repeatedly applying these fixes, consider creating a HOC that wraps your combobox components with these enhancements.
