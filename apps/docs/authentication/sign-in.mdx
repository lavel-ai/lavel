Okay, here's a comprehensive documentation draft explaining the system architecture, components, and workflow of your Lavel AI multi-tenant platform. This is designed to be understandable to someone with a technical background but not necessarily deep familiarity with all the specific technologies used.

# Lavel AI: Multi-Tenant System Architecture Documentation

### 1. Introduction

Lavel AI is a multi-tenant SaaS platform built using Next.js and a monorepo architecture (powered by Turbo Repo). It provides AI-powered legal tools for legal professionals in Mexico. Each organization using Lavel AI is considered a "tenant," and each tenant has its own logically isolated PostgreSQL database (hosted on Neon). Users access their organization's workspace via a unique subdomain (e.g., org-slug.lavel.ai).

### 2. Core Concepts

1.  **Tenant:** A single organization using the Lavel AI platform. Each tenant has its own isolated database.

2.  **Subdomain:** Each tenant is identified by a unique subdomain (e.g., org-slug.lavel.ai). The subdomain is used to determine which tenant database to connect to.

3.  **Main Application Database:** A central PostgreSQL database (also on Neon) that stores global application data, including:

    *   `organizations`: Information about each tenant (organization name, slug, `subdomainSlug`, etc.).  The `subdomainSlug` is critical for routing.
    *   `projects`: Links organizations to their database connection URLs. (The `connectionUrl` field is critical.)
    *   `users`:  User accounts.  Stores the `clerkId` for each user, linking them to Clerk.
    *   `organization_members`: Maps users to organizations (many-to-many relationship, although in the current implementation, users belong to only one organization).

4.  **Tenant Database:** A separate PostgreSQL database for each tenant, containing that tenant's specific data (e.g., legal documents, case information, AI model outputs).

5.  **Authentication:** Handled by Clerk. Users log in on the main domain (lavel.ai) and are then redirected to their organization's subdomain.

6.  **Authorization:** Clerk provides the authentication and basic user information. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) *within* each tenant's application would be a separate layer built on top of this (not fully detailed in the existing code, but mentioned as a future step).

7. **Caching:** Redis, provided by Upstash, is used to cache the mapping between subdomains and database connection URLs, significantly improving performance.

### 3. System Flow (User Login and Data Access)

The following diagram illustrates the request flow, followed by a detailed explanation:

    participant UserBrowser as User Browser
    participant VercelEdge as Vercel Edge Network
    participant AppLayout as App Layout

        else Connection URL Not Found
          TenantDBProvider->>UserBrowser: Redirect to lavel.ai (or 404)
          Note over UserBrowser,VercelEdge: End of flow (error)
        end


    end

   Note over AppLayout: Children components render
    AppLayout->>ServerComponent: Render (Server Component)
   ServerComponent->>TenantDBProvider: useTenantDB() Hook
    TenantDBProvider-->>ServerComponent: Return tenantDb
    ServerComponent->>TenantDB: Query Tenant Database
    TenantDB-->>ServerComponent: Data
    ServerComponent->>UserBrowser: Render UI

```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1.  **Request Initiation:** The user's browser makes a request to either the main domain (lavel.ai) or a tenant subdomain (e.g., tenant-a.lavel.ai).  Authentication is handled by Clerk. If unauthenticated, the user is redirected to the Clerk login/signup pages.

2.  **App Layout (Conditional Redirection):** The `AppLayout` component (`apps/app/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`) runs for authenticated routes.

    *   **Main Domain + Authenticated:**  This is the crucial redirection step.  If the user is on the *main domain* AND is *authenticated*, the layout calls `fetchDefaultOrganizationForUser` to get the user's organization and its `subdomainSlug`.  It then redirects the user to the appropriate subdomain URL.
    *   **Subdomain:** If the user is *already* on a subdomain, the layout does *not* redirect.

3.  **TenantDBProvider (Client Component, Runs on Subdomain):**  The `TenantDBProvider` component (defined in `packages/database/src/tenant-app/provider.tsx`) is a *client* component that wraps the application (or the parts of it that need tenant-specific data).  It's responsible for:

    *   **Identifying the Tenant:**  It calls the `getTenantIdentifier` *server action* (defined in `packages/database/src/tenant-app/utils/tenant-identifier.ts`). This function uses `next/headers` to get the hostname and extract the subdomain. If on the main domain an empty string is returned.
    *   **Retrieving the Connection URL:** It calls the `getTenantConnectionUrlAction` *server action* (defined in `packages/database/src/tenant-app/actions/tenant-actions.ts`) with this subdomain. This server action then uses the original `getTenantConnectionUrl` (located at `@repo/database/src/tenant-app/queries/tenant-lookup.ts` function) to retrieve the connection string.
    * **`getTenantConnectionUrl` (with Redis Caching):**
        *   This function (in `@repo/database/src/tenant-app/queries/tenant-lookup.ts`) first checks the Redis cache for an existing entry for the given subdomain.
        *   **Cache Hit:** If found in Redis, the cached URL is returned immediately.
        *   **Cache Miss:** If not in Redis, the function queries the *main* application database (using Drizzle ORM) to find the organization and its associated project, retrieving the `connectionUrl`. The result is then stored in Redis with a TTL (Time-To-Live) for future requests.
        *   **No Tenant:** If no matching organization/project is found, the function returns `null`.
    *   **Creating the Drizzle Client:**  If a connection URL is found, `TenantDBProvider` creates a tenant-specific Drizzle ORM client using that URL and the tenant database schema.
    *   **Providing the Client via Context:**  The `TenantDBProvider` stores the Drizzle client in a React context (`TenantDBContext`).  Any child component can then access this client using the `useTenantDB` hook.
    *  **Loading and Error States**: It handles loading and error states.
    *   **Handles Main Domain:** If the user is on the main domain (getTenantIdentifier returns an empty string), no tenant context is created.

4.  **Server Components (Accessing the Database):**  Server components (including server actions within those components) that need to access the *tenant-specific* database use the `useTenantDB` hook.  This hook:

    *   Retrieves the `dbClient` from the `TenantDBContext`.
    *   Throws an error if the context is not available (meaning the component isn't wrapped in `TenantDBProvider`), preventing accidental access to the wrong database.
    *  Throws an error if no `dbClient` is present in the context, meaning the component is being render in a place that do not require database connections.

    This ensures that:

    *   Server components *always* use the correct tenant database.
    *   You get a clear error if you accidentally try to use `useTenantDB` outside of the `TenantDBProvider`.
    *   You don't need to pass the `request` object around.

### 4. Component Breakdown:

| Component                               | Location                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AppLayout`                             | `apps/app/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`                                      | Layout for authenticated routes. Handles *post-login redirection* to the user's organization subdomain if the user logged in on the main domain. Gets the user's organization via `fetchDefaultOrganizationForUser`.    |
| `TenantDBProvider`          | `packages/database/src/tenant-app/provider.tsx`             | A *client component* that wraps the application (or relevant parts of it)  It is responsible for identifying the tenant, fetching the database connection URL (via a server action), creating the Drizzle client, and providing it via React Context. |
| `useTenantDB`               | `packages/database/src/tenant-app/provider.tsx`               | A custom React hook that *server components* use to access the tenant-specific Drizzle client from the `TenantDBContext`.  Throws an error if used outside of `TenantDBProvider`.                                   |
| `getTenantIdentifier`       | `packages/database/src/tenant-app/utils/tenant-identifier.ts`   | A *server action* that extracts the tenant identifier (subdomain) from the request headers.  Uses `next/headers`, so it works in server components and route handlers. Returns the subdomain, or an empty string if it's the main domain. |
| `getTenantConnectionUrlAction`       | `packages/database/src/tenant-app/actions/tenant-actions.ts`   | A *server action* that is used for the client component to get the connection string.                  |
| `getTenantConnectionUrl`               | `@repo/database/src/tenant-app/queries/tenant-lookup.ts`                | Retrieves the database connection URL for a given subdomain. Uses Redis caching for performance. Queries the *main* application database if the URL is not in the cache.                                             |
| `fetchDefaultOrganizationForUser`       | `@repo/database/src/main-app/queries/organization-queries.ts`                  | Queries the *main* database to get the organization a user is part of (using the Clerk user ID).                                                                                                                  |
| Route Handlers/Server Components        | `apps/app/...`                                                               | The actual application logic (pages and API endpoints). They use `useTenantDB` to access the appropriate tenant database.                                                                      |
| Main Application Database Schema       | `@repo/database/src/main-app/schema`                                           | Defines the schema for the main application database (`organizations`, `projects`, `users`, `organization_members`).                                                                                                |
| Tenant Database Schema                 | `@repo/database/src/tenant-app/schema`                                         | Defines the schema for *each* tenant's database.  This is where you would define tables specific to your application's data model (e.g., legal documents, client information, etc.).                        |
| Redis Client                          | `@repo/rate-limit/`                             | Used for caching. The same Redis instance can be used for both rate limiting and caching tenant connection URLs.                        |
| Main Application Database           |  `@repo/database/src/main-app/db.ts`          | Initializes the Drizzle client for the main application database using environment variables.|
| Tenant Application Database           |  `@repo/database/src/tenant-app/tenant-connection-db.ts`    | Initializes the Drizzle client for the tenant application database, by creating a tenant connection. |
| Clerk Webhook Handler (Optional)           |  `apps/api/app/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`    | Handles webhook events from Clerk (e.g. user creation, organization membership changes), Can be use to keep the main application database synchronized with Clerk. Currently updates user metadata but this is no longer the primary way to get organization information. |

### 5. Component Interactions:

*   The **User Browser** initiates requests to either the main domain or a tenant subdomain.
*   **Vercel Edge Network** routes the request to the appropriate Next.js application.
* **AppLayout** Get user information using the clerk auth api. Check if it is the main domain and redirect the user to it's default organization, otherwise, do nothing.
*   **TenantDBProvider:** (Client Component) This component renders on every request to a tenant subdomain.
    *   It uses `getTenantIdentifier` (server action) to get the subdomain.
    *   It uses `getTenantConnectionUrlAction` (server action) to retrieve the connection URL.
    *   It creates the `DrizzleClient` and makes it available via context.
*   **Server Components:** Use the `useTenantDB` hook to get the `DrizzleClient` from context.
*   **`getTenantConnectionUrl`** interacts with both Redis and the Main Database to retrieve connection URLs.
