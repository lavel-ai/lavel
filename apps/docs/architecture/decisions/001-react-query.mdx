# ADR-001: Adopt React Query for State Management

## Context

- Components were implementing their own data fetching logic
- Duplicate network requests were occurring for the same data
- Error handling and loading states were inconsistent
- No caching strategy existed, causing performance issues

## Decision

We will adopt React Query as our primary solution for server state management.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Centralized data fetching and caching reduces network requests
- Consistent loading and error states across the application
- Automatic background refetching keeps data fresh
- Built-in pagination and infinite scroll support
- Devtools for debugging and cache inspection

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers new to React Query
- Additional dependency to maintain
- Can increase bundle size slightly
